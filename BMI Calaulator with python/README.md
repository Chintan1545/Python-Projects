# 🧮 BMI Calculator using Python

A simple **Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator** built using Python.
This program takes user input for height and weight, calculates BMI, and classifies the health category.

---

## 📌 📖 Project Overview

This project calculates BMI using the standard formula:

[
BMI = \frac{weight (kg)}{height (m)^2}
]

Based on the BMI value, the program categorizes the user into:

* Severely Underweight
* Underweight
* Healthy
* Overweight
* Severely Overweight

## 🚀 Features

✅ Takes height in centimeters
✅ Takes weight in kilograms
✅ Converts height into meters automatically
✅ Calculates BMI accurately
✅ Displays BMI up to 2 decimal places
✅ Categorizes health condition
✅ Handles invalid input (zero or negative values)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Conditional Statements
* User Input Handling
* Basic Mathematical Operations

## 💻 How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chintan1545/BMI-Calculator.git
```

### 2️⃣ Navigate to Project Folder

```bash
cd BMI-Calculator
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Program

```bash
python BMI_Calaulator_with_python.py
```

## 🧾 Sample Output

```
Enter your height in cm: 166
Enter your weight in kg: 75
Your Body Mass Index (BMI) is: 27.22
You are overweight
```

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User enters height (cm) and weight (kg)
2. Height is converted from cm to meters
3. BMI formula is applied
4. Conditional statements determine health category
5. Result is printed to the console

## 🎯 BMI Classification Table

| BMI Range | Category             |
| --------- | -------------------- |
| ≤ 16      | Severely Underweight |
| 16 - 18.5 | Underweight          |
| 18.5 - 25 | Healthy              |
| 25 - 30   | Overweight           |
| > 30      | Severely Overweight  |
